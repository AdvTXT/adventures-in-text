To do

- when doing grammar, make sure that user cannot leave room if still standing on something (alternatively, set obj.has_user to False)
- put object attributes as default arguments so that they can be customized more easily
- have dynamic container and room descriptions so that they can return something about the objects inside them
    - Container.look_in returns container.objects
- better way to set room exits
- have grammar dealt with in its own function?  
  - have a function that splits up action and deals with it appropriately.
- better grammar for underscore actions (e.g. look_in -- be able to say "look in <object>")
- 'start a new game' button on site
