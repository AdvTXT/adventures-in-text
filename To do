To do

- when doing grammar, make sure that user cannot leave room if still standing on something (alternatively, set obj.has_user to False)
- put object attributes as default arguments so that they can be customized more easily
- have dynamic container and room descriptions so that they can return something about the objects inside them
    - Container.look_in returns container.objects

- better way to set room exits
