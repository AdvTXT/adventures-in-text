To do

- when doing grammar, make sure that user cannot leave room if still standing on something (alternatively, set obj.has_user to False)
- put object attributes as default arguments so that they can be customized more easily
- have dynamic container descriptions so that they can return something about the objects inside them
- have global room and inventory
  - this will also make it easier to use object.get(), because the room/container and inventory won't have to be passed in explicitly
- how to change rooms -- have a LOCATION variable?
